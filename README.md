# Analytics for your Youtube Channel

## Questions?
- :relaxed: Are you curious about the statistics of your own Youtube Channel or any popular Youtube Channel? 
- :smile: Are the view counts and like counts of the videos increasing?

## Solution
This repository demonstrates how you could grab and visualize the public data of your Youtube channel or any popular Channel through Youtube API requests, and get insights with this Youtube Channel Analytics Dashboard. 

On this prototype Dashboard 1.0, you will find the geographic distributions, time series summary statistics, top items, and more for a pre-defined channel 'Sunday Driver'. You could reveal the view counts, like counts, and comment counts of any individual video by using the interactive tools. 

## Prototype Dashboard 1.0 Demostration
I can't wait to share this prototype Dashboard 1.0. But, this is an on-going project, and I will keep updating as the project improves.

## Future direction
This Dashboard has the potential of grabing the real time data of any channel of your choice, and display the information on the Dashboard. However, due to the restrictions on the daily free quota of the Youtube Channel API. This functions is not connected to the Dashboard at this stage. You could still get the real time data using your own API key. 

# Reproduciable Steps
1. Get API KEY followed instructions here: https://www.slickremix.com/docs/get-api-key-for-youtube
2. Load in API KEY from saved file
3. Specify the Youtube Channel ID of your choice, run the code, and get the data locally
4. Connect the data to the Dashboard application.
